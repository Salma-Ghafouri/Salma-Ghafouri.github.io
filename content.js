            "My name is Salma, and I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Islamic Azad University (ranked second among Iranian universities according to the US News ranking) with a GPA of 3.41 out of 4 over my last two years. I was impressed by the research and work on NDT (Nondestructive Testing) and mechatronics.",
            "Regarding research, I successfully published four papers and submitted a patent in the field of Nondestructive Testing. In addition, I expanded my knowledge in Nondestructive Testing and Robotics by working on several projects, such as a Line tracking robot, a Car cabin simulation, and the Design and simulation of a robot in Catia software. These experiences, in addition to participating in various workshops on different subjects, helped me to hone my skills."
